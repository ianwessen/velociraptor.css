			<h3>Small, fast CSS Boilerplate</h3>
			<p>
				This project is a single CSS sheet that makes raw HTML look nice. It's
				small, it's fast, it's just like velociraptor.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wouldn't it be nice if a raw HTML page looked nice? Why can't we make
				some common sense improvements to the raw elements of a webpage without
				adding extra build tools? Why exactly can't we clone dinosaurs from
				amber-preserverd mosquito DNA?
			</p>

				Source code is available

			<h1>Velociraptor</h1>
			<p>
				Velociraptor was a <b>small theropod dromaeosaur</b> of the
				<a href="#">Upper Cretaceous</a>, about 75–71 million years ago. It was
				a slender, lightly built carnivore. It was about two meters long and
				0.62 meters tall at the hip, <em>bigger than the common chimpanzee</em>.
				Velociraptor had one <u>sickle-shaped claw</u> on its foot which
				measured 6.5 centimeters along its length, and a smaller one on each
				hand.
			</p>

			<p>
				Velociraptor was warm blooded and had feathers<sup
					>[citation needed]</sup
				>. Fossils from China suggest that the whole clade had similar traits.
				Fossils of Velociraptor were first found in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia
				in 1922<sub>[footnote]</sub>. In 1988, scientists from
				<strike>India</strike> China found Velociraptor skeletons in northern
				China.
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				A lack of quill knobs does not necessarily mean that a dinosaur did not
				have feathers. Finding quill knobs on Velociraptor, though, means that
				it definitely had feathers. This is something we'd long suspected, but
				no one had been able to prove

			<p>Unordered lists have basic styles</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					They use the circle list style

						<li>Nested lists styled to feel right</li>
						<li>Can nest either type of list into the other</li>
						<li>Dinosaurs also likely exhibited nesting</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A good list is a simple list</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Features linking birds and dinosaurs:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Feathered limbs.</li>
				<li>
					Hollow, pneumatized bones including the appearance of:
					<ul>
