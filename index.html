			Velociraptor is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived
			approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the latter part of the
			Cretaceous Period. Two species are currently recognized, although others
			have been assigned in the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis;
			fossils of this species have been discovered in Mongolia. A second
			species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material from Inner
			Mongolia, China.
